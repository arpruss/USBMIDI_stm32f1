/*
 * This is the Midi class.  If you are just sending Midi data, you only need to make an
 *  instance of the class, passing it your serial port -- in most cases it looks like
 *
 *   USBMidi midi(channel);
 *
 *  then you don't need to do anything else; you can start using it to send Midi messages,
 *  e.g.
 *
 *   midi.sendNoteOn(1, note, velocity);
 *
 * If you are using it to receive Midi data, it's a little more complex & you will need
 *  to subclass the Midi class.
 *
 *  For people not used to C++ this may look confusing, but it's actually pretty easy.
 *   Note that you only need to write the functions for event types you want to handle.
 *   They should match the names & prototypes of the functions in the class; look at
 *   the functions in the Midi class below that have the keyword "virtual" to see which
 *   ones you can use.
 *
 *   Here's an example of one that takes NOTE ON, NOTE OFF, and CONTROL CHANGE:
 *
 *   class MyMidi : public USBMidi {
 *     public:
 *
 *     // Need this to compile; it just hands things off to the Midi class.
 *     MyMidi() : USBMidi(s) {}
 *
 *     void handleNoteOn(unsigned int channel, unsigned int note, unsigned int velocity)
 *     {
 *         if (note == 40) {digitalWrite(13, HIGH); }
 *     }
 *
 *     void handleNoteOff(unsigned int channel, unsigned int note, unsigned int velocity)
 *     {
 *       if (note == 40) { digitalWrite(13, LOW); }
 *     }
 *
 *     void handleControlChange(unsigned int channel, unsigned int controller,
 *                              unsigned int value)
 *     {
 *       analogWrite(6, value * 2);
 *     }
 *
 *   Then you need to make an instance of this class:
 *
 *     MyMidi midi();
 *
 *   If receiving Midi data, you also need to call the poll function every time through
 *    loop(); e.g.
 *
 *    void loop() {
 *      midi.poll();
 *    }
 *
 *   This causes the Midi class to read data from the serial port and process it.
